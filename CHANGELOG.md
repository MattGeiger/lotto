# Changelog

## 2025-11-22
- Removed client-side polling timers from `/admin` and `/display` to keep form inputs stable while editing.
- Added a standalone read-only board server (`npm run readonly`) on its own port that polls the persisted JSON state.
- Updated documentation to cover the new read-only board and the non-polling behavior of the main UI.
- Restyled the read-only board with a high-contrast theme, clearer labels, and simplified header content.
- Updated the read-only board header to show the service date and removed the footer disclaimer text.
- Fixed date formatting in the read-only board script to avoid template literal parsing errors.
