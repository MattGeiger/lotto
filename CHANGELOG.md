# Changelog

## 2025-11-22
- Removed client-side polling timers from `/admin` and `/display` to keep form inputs stable while editing.
- Added a standalone read-only board server (`npm run readonly`) on its own port that polls the persisted JSON state.
- Updated documentation to cover the new read-only board and the non-polling behavior of the main UI.
- Restyled the read-only board with a high-contrast theme, clearer labels, and simplified header content.
- Updated the read-only board header to show the service date and removed the footer disclaimer text.
- Fixed date formatting in the read-only board script to avoid template literal parsing errors.
- Reformatted the read-only board title to show full weekday and ordinal date (e.g., “Saturday, 22nd November, 2025”).
- Adjusted read-only title to show the date without duplicate prefix and to format as “Saturday, November 22nd, 2025”.
- Expanded the read-only board layout to occupy more viewport width.
- Enlarged raffle number badges on the read-only board for better long-distance readability.
- Further increased raffle number badge size and weight for maximum visibility.
- Widened the top info cards and increased their number sizing to stay larger than the raffle badges.
- Changed the admin “Now Serving” control to step through draw positions with arrow buttons using Lucide icons and ordinal labels.
- Added a distinct style for already-called tickets on the read-only board.
- Updated read-only board styling to make served tickets pop and mute upcoming tickets instead.
- Loosened spacing and line-height for read-only number badges and summary numbers to avoid cropped digits.
- Added horizontal spacing for raffle badges and widened their padding for better legibility.
- Protected raffle order when switching modes: mode toggles now only affect future tickets, keep existing order intact, and require confirmation.
- Replaced the “William Temple House” pill on the landing page with the official horizontal logo asset for better branding.
- Removed the “Digital Raffle” pill and expanded the homepage logo to span the card responsively.
- Centralized UI styling around global design tokens in `globals.css` and refactored button, badge, card, input, switch, tooltip, and separator components to consume them.
- Increased contrast for primary buttons via the shared `Button` component rather than page-level overrides.
- Fixed anchor inheritance inside buttons so CTA text uses the button’s foreground color instead of the global link color.
- Increased contrast on the “Open Staff Dashboard” CTA to prevent text blending into the button background.
- Ensured all cards use the solid surface background to match the landing page styling.
- Aligned the read-only board shell to the top of the viewport.
- Removed the mode pill from public and admin headers to simplify the UI and avoid low-contrast badges.
- Added the William Temple House horizontal logo to the top of the read-only board.
- Served static assets (e.g., the read-only board logo) from `public/` so they render correctly.
- Tweaked the draw position arrows so the previous arrow stays muted/outlined and the next arrow remains emphasized.
- Swapped draw-position button styles: previous now uses the filled secondary style, next uses the outlined muted style.
