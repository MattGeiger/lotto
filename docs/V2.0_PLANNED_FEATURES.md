# v2.0 Planned Features

**Status:** Planning  
**Working branch:** `codex/arcade`  
**Release intent:** v2.0 major upgrade  
**Scope:** Introduce a distinct Arcade product area with launch game support

---

## Summary

Version 2.0 introduces a new **Arcade** section that is intentionally separated from the raffle experience.

The v2.0 launch includes:

1. A dedicated Arcade page with retro 8-bit visual direction.
2. An always-visible top banner showing **NOW SERVING** so clients can still monitor queue progress.
3. A game selection menu on the Arcade page.
4. Snake as the first playable game.

Additional games are planned after launch.

## Current Implementation Checkpoint (2026-02-16)

- Completed: Dedicated `/arcade` and `/arcade/snake` routes with Arcade-scoped layout/styling.
- Completed: Persistent `NOW SERVING` Arcade banner with adaptive polling parity to the display strategy.
- Completed: Arcade menu UI and Snake navigation shell with stable board container + mobile D-pad controls.
- Completed: Mobile usability scaffolding (`PLAY NOW` focus jump, on-screen controls, keyboard input capture shell).
- Completed: Snake navigation increment with fixed 3-segment movement and collision-based game-over/restart flow.
- Completed: Snake food pellet spawn and score increment loop with growth-on-food enabled.
- Completed: Snake pause/resume control flow and non-obscuring readout placement (stats moved outside the board).
- Completed: Arcade `NOW SERVING` update alert treatment tuned for retro visibility while preserving the section aesthetic.
- In progress: Snake game-loop hardening tasks.
- Pending: Snake engine tests and final MVP validation criteria before v2.0 release.

## Alignment With Project Guardrails

- **WITHIN existing patterns:** Arcade is implemented as its own route group and feature boundary, not inside the public display page.
- **WITHIN existing patterns:** Arcade styling is scoped to Arcade; raffle theme and UI patterns remain unchanged.
- **WITHIN existing patterns:** Snake game logic is independent from raffle state APIs and raffle UI components.

## v2.0 Product Goals

1. Make Arcade feel like its own mini-product area in both code and UX.
2. Preserve queue visibility by keeping **NOW SERVING** always visible during Arcade usage.
3. Ship a clean game-launch flow with Snake as the initial offering.
4. Establish a scalable foundation for adding future simple games.

---

## In Scope (v2.0)

### 1) Dedicated Arcade Surface
- Add a dedicated Arcade route and layout (`/arcade` and `/arcade/*`).
- Keep Arcade code isolated under Arcade-specific folders.

### 2) Persistent Queue Awareness Banner
- Show a top banner with **NOW SERVING** on all Arcade pages.
- Banner remains visible while browsing the game menu and while playing Snake.
- Banner should prioritize legibility and low cognitive load.

### 3) Arcade Menu (Launch)
- Provide a simple game selection menu on `/arcade`.
- Include a primary CTA/button to start Snake.
- Keep menu structure ready for adding future game entries.

### 4) Snake Launch Game
- Deliver a playable Snake MVP for mobile and desktop browser contexts.
- Keep Snake gameplay separate from raffle UI/state semantics.

### 5) Retro 8-bit Visual Direction
- Apply pixel-art style graphics and UI treatment for Arcade surfaces.
- Keep this visual system scoped to Arcade.

---

## Out of Scope (v2.0)

- Embedding game content into `/` or `src/components/readonly-display.tsx`.
- Reusing raffle-specific UI elements for Snake (ticket grid/status classes/queue legend patterns).
- Coupling gameplay to `/api/state` write flows.
- Multi-game release beyond Snake (other games deferred to post-v2.0 iterations).

## Proposed Route and Feature Shape

```text
src/
  app/
    (arcade)/
      arcade/
        layout.tsx      # includes persistent NOW SERVING top banner
        page.tsx        # game selection menu
        snake/
          page.tsx      # launch game
  arcade/
    components/
    ui/
    game/
    hooks/
    styles/
```

---

## UX Requirements (v2.0)

1. **Always-visible NOW SERVING:** The top banner remains present during gameplay.
2. **Fast entry to play:** User can reach Snake in one tap/click from Arcade menu.
3. **Clear separation:** Arcade should not visually resemble raffle display/admin surfaces.
4. **Mobile first:** Menu and Snake controls must be usable in simulated mobile testing.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- `/arcade` renders a game selection menu with a Snake launch button.
- `/arcade/snake` is playable and preserves the persistent top **NOW SERVING** banner.
- Arcade UI uses retro/pixel direction and does not reuse raffle-specific UI patterns.
- Arcade implementation remains isolated from raffle display component architecture.
- Design and behavior are validated in local mobile simulation before production rollout.

---

## Post-v2.0 Follow-ons (Planned)

- Add additional simple games to the menu.
- Expand Arcade polish and progression features after Snake launch stability.
- Evaluate optional local-only score retention and per-game settings.
