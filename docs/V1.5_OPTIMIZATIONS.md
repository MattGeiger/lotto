# v1.5 Performance Optimizations

**Status:** Phases 1, 2, 3, 4a, key Phase 4/6 items, feature-flagged optimistic action UX, draw-path pending/render isolation, history-cost controls, and automatic motion-tier degradation are implemented. Remaining work reprioritized below.  
**Target branch:** `main`  
**Scope:** Admin/display responsiveness on low-power devices (iPad mini 4) with best-effort legacy support  
**Last updated:** February 20, 2026  
**Supersedes:** Original animation-only plan (February 13, 2026)

---

## Pattern Alignment
- WITHIN existing patterns in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/ISSUES.md` (Issue 14 and Issue 15).
- Incremental optimization only. No architectural rewrite and no dependency changes in this planning update.
- Keeps focus on the existing `/admin`, `/display`, and state manager flows.

## Compatibility Baseline Reality Check (2026-02-20)

| Area | Current fact | Expected implication for iPad mini 4 |
|---|---|---|
| Device OS ceiling | iPad mini 4 remains on iPadOS 15 security branch; Apple published iPadOS **15.8.6** on August 19, 2025. | Device is on a legacy WebKit branch compared to modern framework baselines. |
| Current major iPadOS support | Apple major iPadOS compatibility pages start at iPad mini (5th generation) and newer. | iPad mini 4 is legacy-only and should be treated as graceful-degradation target. |
| Next.js 16 baseline | Next.js 16 docs target modern browsers and list Safari **16.4+**. | iPad mini 4 Safari is below stated framework baseline. |
| Tailwind CSS v4 baseline | Tailwind v4 compatibility lists Safari **16.4+** baseline. | Some emitted CSS behavior will rely on fallback handling on iPadOS 15.x. |
| WebKit milestones | `color-mix()` shipped in Safari 16.2; additional `touch-action` value behavior documented in Safari 16.4. | Use verification-first compatibility approach and avoid assuming full parity on iPadOS 15.x. |

**Support policy inference:** `/admin` on iPad mini 4 is a **best-effort critical-path support target**, not a strict full-parity target against modern Safari 16.4+ baselines.

## 1. Problem Summary

### Observed Behavior
- On iPad mini 4 (A8, 2 GB RAM, iPadOS 15.8.6 security branch), `/admin` can still show lag:
  - Typed input lag in range/reset fields is now mostly resolved after component isolation and O(1) preview work.
  - Residual lag is now concentrated on button/tap actions (especially Draw Position next/prev/clear) when server persistence roundtrips are slow.
  - Snapshot-history coupling is no longer the primary action-latency bottleneck after decoupling.
- `/display` can still feel heavy on first load when large ticket grids and animations mount.
- Modern iPads/desktops remain noticeably faster and mask these bottlenecks.

### Device Context
- **CPU**: Apple A8 (2014), substantially slower single-thread performance than newer iPad chips.
- **RAM**: 2 GB total; Safari tab memory pressure is materially tighter than modern devices.
- **GPU**: Limited compositing headroom for many simultaneous animated elements.
- **Runtime gap**: iPad mini 4 browser stack is below Next.js 16 / Tailwind v4 documented Safari baselines.
- **Touch behavior**: `touch-action: manipulation` is already enabled globally and is still required for perceived responsiveness on this class of hardware.

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis (Current State)

### 2A. Confirmed Wins Already Shipped (v1.5.1)
- Derived admin values are memoized (`useMemo`) to avoid repeated expensive recomputation.
- Duplicate `listSnapshots` fetch loop from prior `useEffect([state])` path is removed.
- DB `listSnapshots` query now returns metadata only (`id`, `created_at`).
- Global `touch-action: manipulation` is in place.

These wins reduced baseline overhead but did not eliminate all lag paths on iPad mini 4.

### 2B. Snapshot Refresh Decoupling Is Now Implemented
- `sendAction` now finalizes user-visible action completion before triggering snapshot refresh in the background.
- `fetchState` now prioritizes loading state first and no longer blocks initial interactive admin render on snapshot listing.
- Undo/redo now use the same decoupled action path.

Result: snapshot-list latency is no longer directly on the user-critical action completion path.

### 2B.1. Post-Input-Optimization Observation (2026-02-20)
- On-device iPad mini 4 testing shows typed input is significantly improved.
- Remaining perceived lag is dominated by action button roundtrip (write/read persistence), not local keystroke rendering fan-out.
- This shifts highest-impact optimization from additional keystroke isolation to action-path UX masking and rollback-safe reconciliation.

### 2C. Keystroke Isolation for Range and Reset Inputs Is Now Implemented
- Start/End range inputs were moved into an isolated local-state child (`RangeGenerationControls`) so typing no longer updates the root `AdminPage` state on every keypress (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`).
- Reset confirmation phrase input was moved into an isolated local-state child (`ResetActionControls`) for the same reason (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`).
- Both sections are memoized and now re-render locally while the rest of `/admin` remains stable during typing.

Result: keystroke rendering fan-out is reduced from page-wide to section-local for these high-frequency inputs.

### 2D. `previewUndrawnCount` O(1) Path Is Now Implemented for End-Range Edits
- In range preview logic, extending end number beyond current server end now uses:
  - `previewUndrawn = serverUndrawnCount + (previewEnd - state.endNumber)`
- This avoids per-keystroke `start..previewEnd` scanning in the common append-preview path (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`).

Result: range-end editing cost no longer scales linearly with range size in the dominant path.

### 2E. Async Error Propagation Hardening Is Partially Implemented
- `sendAction` still rethrows after toast by design.
- Main draw-navigation call-sites now catch and consume those rethrows after toast reporting, removing the previously observed unhandled rejection in tests.
- Follow-up remains to audit all remaining action call-sites for the same guarantee.

### 2F. `/admin` Client Payload Is Still Heavy for A8-Class Devices
- Current build references 8 client chunks for `/admin`, around **508 KB uncompressed** and about **160 KB gzip** aggregate from chunk inspection.

Result: parse/execute and hydration costs remain non-trivial on iPad mini 4 class hardware.

### 2G. Display Animation Cost Is Still Secondary Load
- Ticket grid mounts with per-item fade animation and staggered delay in `/display` (`src/components/readonly-display.tsx:830`).
- Clock updates every 30 seconds regardless of whether date output changes (`src/components/readonly-display.tsx:341`).

Result: not primary `/admin` input lag cause, but still contributes to low-power smoothness debt.

### 2H. CSS Compatibility: Verify Generated Fallbacks Before Manual Overrides
- Source tokens still use `color-mix()` in `globals.css`, but current built CSS emits fallback token values guarded by `@supports` checks.

Result: compatibility action should start with on-device verification of generated CSS output before adding manual fallback layers.

### 2I. Optimistic Action UX Is Implemented Behind a Feature Flag
- `/admin` now includes a feature-flagged optimistic dispatcher (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_OPTIMISTIC_UI`) with immediate local patch application and server-authoritative reconciliation.
- Draw navigation uses single-flight request processing with queue-one behavior to keep taps responsive under latency.
- Failure path clears optimistic patches, shows toast, and triggers `fetchState()` safety resync.

Result: perceived button latency can be reduced without changing backend persistence contracts.

### 2J. Draw-Path Pending/Render Isolation Is Now Implemented
- Pending state is now split into draw vs non-draw channels (`pendingDrawAction`, `pendingNonDrawAction`) so draw taps no longer mute unrelated controls.
- Draw controls are now isolated in memoized `DrawPositionControls`, reducing draw-path render fan-out in the main admin tree.

Result: draw interactions no longer force broad non-draw control disable cycles, improving perceived responsiveness on older devices.

### 2K. Draw-Path History Cost Controls Are Now Implemented
- Draw-triggered snapshot refresh is now deferred (`DRAW_SNAPSHOT_REFRESH_DELAY_MS`) so immediate draw feedback is not followed by synchronous history work.
- History option rendering is now capped (`SNAPSHOT_RENDER_PAGE_SIZE`) with an explicit "Show older snapshots" checkbox affordance.
- Snapshot refresh avoids redundant list state churn when metadata payload is unchanged.

Result: large snapshot inventories impose materially less layout/reflow cost during draw interactions on iPad mini 4 class hardware.

### 2L. Automatic Display Motion Tiering Is Now Implemented (No Manual Controls)
- Morphing text now auto-selects a runtime motion tier (`full`, `simple`, `off`) using:
  - reduced-motion preference (`prefers-reduced-motion`),
  - a short `requestAnimationFrame` frame-time probe,
  - lightweight capability hints (`hardwareConcurrency`, `deviceMemory` when available).
- Tier result is persisted in `localStorage` to avoid re-probing on every visit.
- `MorphingText` now supports:
  - `full`: existing per-character morph behavior.
  - `simple`: single-element text transition (no per-character span fan-out).
  - `off`: static text swap.
- This rollout explicitly avoids manual animation controls while still preserving premium motion on stronger devices.

Result: older iPad-class devices avoid expensive character-level animation fan-out, while newer devices keep current visual quality.

## 3. Optimization Strategy and Priority

### Completed Phases
- **Phase 1 (done):** Admin memoization for derived values.
- **Phase 2 (done):** Removed duplicate snapshot fetch loop and slimmed DB snapshot listing payload.
- **Phase 3 (done):** Decoupled snapshot refresh from action completion and initial state load path.
- **Phase 4a (done):** Added global `touch-action: manipulation`.
- **Phase 4 (done for critical inputs):** Isolated range + reset keystroke state into local child components.
- **Phase 6 (done for dominant path):** Implemented O(1) preview-undrawn computation for end-range extension previews.
- **Phase 11 (done behind flag):** Implemented optimistic action dispatcher with rollback-safe reconciliation and queue-one draw navigation.
- **Phase 11.1 (done):** Split draw/non-draw pending channels and isolated Draw Position controls into a memoized component.
- **Phase 11.2 (done):** Deferred draw-path snapshot refresh and capped History snapshot option rendering with a checkbox toggle for older snapshots.
- **Phase 12 (done):** Added automatic runtime motion-tier degradation for `MorphingText` (`full/simple/off`) with persisted classification and reduced-motion preference handling.

### Remaining Phases (Reordered)

### Phase 11 Follow-up (P0): Validate and Tune Optimistic Rollout
- Validate optimistic mode on iPad mini 4 with Safari Web Inspector traces for draw-button taps.
- Confirm rollback and resync behavior under forced request failures and high-latency network conditions.
- Roll out `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_OPTIMISTIC_UI=true` by environment after staging validation.

### Phase 11.1 Follow-up (P0): Continue Draw-Critical Section Isolation
- Keep draw taps scoped to draw-critical UI updates.
- Minimize redraw of heavy non-draw sections (history/options, status grids, settings cards) during draw actions.

### Phase 11.2 Follow-up (P0): Tune History-Cost Guardrails
- Profile iPad mini 4 with large snapshot inventories and tune `DRAW_SNAPSHOT_REFRESH_DELAY_MS`.
- Tune `SNAPSHOT_RENDER_PAGE_SIZE` for the lowest long-task footprint without hurting restore workflows.

### Phase 4 Follow-up (P1): Extend Input Isolation to Remaining High-Frequency Fields
- Range and reset isolation are complete.
- Next split candidates: returned/unclaimed ticket inputs and any remaining high-frequency text fields.

### Phase 5 (P1): Async Error Hardening Follow-up
- Main unhandled rejection path in draw navigation handlers is fixed.
- Continue auditing remaining action call-sites for consistent catch/report behavior.

### Phase 7 (P2): Client Payload Discipline
- Measure `/admin` chunk composition and defer non-critical client dependencies.
- Keep first-interaction path lightweight for low-power devices.

### Phase 8 (P2): Display Animation and Clock Follow-up
- Automatic motion tiering is now in place.
- Next focus: reduce remaining non-morph animation load (grid entry fades/staggers and other incidental motion) on low-tier devices.
- Cap large-grid stagger animations.
- Update display clock only when formatted output actually changes.

### Phase 9 (P3): Compatibility Hardening (Verification-First)
- First verify generated CSS fallback behavior on actual iPad mini 4 Safari.
- Add manual `color-mix()` fallback declarations only if a real on-device gap remains.

### Phase 10 (P3): API Transport Follow-up
- Evaluate `ETag` / `If-None-Match` for `GET /api/state`.
- Confirm compression behavior for typical state payload sizes.

## 5. Verification Plan

### Instrumentation
- Use Safari Web Inspector on real iPad mini 4:
  - Performance timeline for range input typing.
  - Network waterfall for one queue action with slow snapshot listing.
  - Long-task timeline and memory pressure indicators.

### Test Scenarios
1. Type 6 digits into Start/End fields with active queue state and capture keystroke responsiveness.
2. Tap Next/Prev repeatedly and measure tap-to-visible-state-update latency.
3. Simulate slow `listSnapshots` and verify action completion UI is not blocked by history refresh.
4. With optimistic mode enabled, verify rapid double-tap Next queues exactly one additional draw action.
5. Verify third rapid tap while queue is full is ignored deterministically.
6. Force an action failure and confirm optimistic rollback + toast + state resync.
7. Verify draw-tap actions do not mute unrelated non-draw controls (for example mode toggle) while draw request is in flight.
8. Load History with >200 snapshots and verify initial render caps options while the "Show older snapshots" checkbox toggles full list visibility.
9. On older iPad hardware, verify morph-text transitions auto-fallback to `simple` or `off` behavior (no character-level fan-out).
10. On newer hardware, verify morph-text quality remains full fidelity.
11. Load `/display` with large ticket grid and compare first meaningful paint before/after animation caps.
12. Validate no regression in Issue 14 and Issue 15 behavior in `docs/ISSUES.md`.

### Acceptance Metrics (iPad mini 4 critical path)
- **Keystroke to paint:** p95 <= 120 ms, p99 <= 200 ms.
- **Tap to visible state update:** p95 <= 300 ms (excluding server round-trip delay).
- **Optimistic draw update:** first visible draw-position update should occur immediately on tap (target: next paint frame under normal UI-thread conditions).
- **First interactive admin render:** <= 2.5 s on warm network path.
- **Long tasks (>50 ms) while typing:** <= 2 within a 10-keystroke burst.
- **Slow snapshot listing case:** action UI must complete independently of history refresh.
- **Optimistic rollback safety:** no stale optimistic state remains visible after failed action response.

### Current Command Checkpoint (February 20, 2026)
- On-device validation update:
  - iPad mini 4 typed-input lag is materially improved.
  - Residual lag remains on button/tap actions under slow persistence roundtrips.
  - Manual cleanup of old snapshots reduced draw lag on-device, confirming History rendering cost as a contributing factor.
- Implementation update:
  - Feature-flagged optimistic `/admin` action UX is now in place for validation (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_OPTIMISTIC_UI`).
  - Draw-path pending-state split and memoized Draw Position controls are now implemented to reduce global UI muting on draw taps.
  - Draw-triggered snapshot refresh is deferred and History option rendering is now capped with a clearer checkbox affordance to reduce iPad layout pressure while keeping access to older snapshots obvious.
  - Morph text now uses automatic runtime motion-tier degradation (`full/simple/off`) with persisted classification; no manual animation setting was added.
- `npm test -- tests/admin-page-actions.test.tsx tests/admin-range-locking.test.tsx tests/admin-optimistic-ui.test.tsx`:
  - 19 assertions passed (including optimistic queue/rollback coverage and History-cap coverage).
- `npm test -- tests/motion-tier.test.ts`:
  - 6 assertions passed (classification thresholds + tier value guard).
- `npm test`:
  - 389 assertions passed across 42 test files.
  - No Vitest unhandled rejection errors reported.
- `npm run build`:
  - Build passed.
  - Baseline-browser-mapping staleness warning observed (no additional compatibility warning classes).
